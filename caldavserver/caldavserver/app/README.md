# Smart Calendar Application

This is the actual implementation of the Smart Calendar functionality, also appropriately called the Business Logic or maybe the Controller if you like.

The app component of this project *may* move out to its own project repository as a stand-alone code block that could be used in a microservice deployment or something along those lines.
